    <h2>Questions and Answers About Sustainable WordPress Development</h2>

        <li>How can I use WordPress sustainably?</li>
        <li>Is WordPress eco-friendly and sustainable?</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Individually optimized WordPress themes</h3>
      <p>For <a href="https://kleiderordnung.berlin/" target="_blank">Kleiderordnung.Berlin</a>, Ingo programmed a hybrid WordPress theme using custom fields and custom post types, restricting the Gutenberg editor to certain pages. His blog,
 <a href="https://www.open-mind-culture.org/" target="_blank">open-mind-culture.org</a>, is another proof that WordPress websites can be ecologically efficient and load quickly.</p>

      <h3>Sustainable WordPress Development</h3>
      <p>A sustainably oriented (WordPress) web developer can help make digitalization more ecological and program beautiful and fast, economically sustainable websites with little maintenance and long-lasting open-source technology.</p>

      <p>WordPress celebrated its 20th birthday in 2023, forming the technical basis for millions of websites. Thanks to the numerous free training options, it is easy to find employees who can maintain and extend a website's content without you having to learn it yourself or hire professional programmers.</p>

      <h3>Focus, maintainability and long life</h3>
      <p>Web development (programming) should be limited to programming modular components (themes and plugins) that have a long lifespan and can be easily customised and extended. As an alternative to the popular patchwork of freely available plugins, individual programming can create a sustainable basis that is elegant, efficient and accessible right from the start. Web developers can also give advice on the selection and structure (architecture) of software components and subsequently optimise existing WordPress websites.</p>

      <h3 class="target-offset" id="plugin-programmierung">Open Source / Plugin Development</h3>
      <p>Ingo is currently developing WordPress extensions to <a href="https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/incompatibility-status/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detect plugin conflicts early</a> and to <a href="https://github.com/openmindculture/wp-contact-form-inbox-report-mailer-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">send spam reports of WordPress contact forms</a>. He has already developed and published extensions and themes for Shopware, WebStorm and IntelliJ IDEA, including the free <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16721-cute-pink-light-theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cute Pink Light Theme</a>.</p>
