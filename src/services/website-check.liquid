            <h2>Questions and Answers about Website Testing</h2>
            <p>No matter how beautiful and successful your website looks, there is always room for improvement.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you also became aware of my offer because of a very specific problem.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text-width-children mb0">
            <h3>Is your website not generating enough inquiries and sales?</h3>
            <p>There can be many different reasons for commercial success or failure on the Internet, which need to be analysed more closely. Are enough potential customers from the right target group visiting your website? Do they stay there and do they find the content intended for them? Is it easy to buy something from you or to get in touch?</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text-width-children mb0">
            <h3>Which success factors can we measure?</h3>
            <p>Time and money are very obvious and measurable values: How long does it take for my website to load? How long does it take for someone to buy something? Are my sales increasing or decreasing? What are my costs? We can also measure visitor numbers, data volumes, the number of errors and compliance with criteria such as accessibility.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text-width-children mb0">
            <h3>What problems can hinder your online success?</h3>
            <p>Long loading times and lack of accessibility are often overlooked problems. These can make potential sales and conversions just as difficult as poor discoverability in search engine results, difficult-to-understand or unbelievable content, technical errors, poor accessibility, and total website failures.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text-width-children mb0">
            <h3>How can you advertise sustainably and credibly?</h3>
            <p>It could be so simple: Do good and talk about it! However, it is not only transparency obligations such as the upcoming Green Claims Directive, but also suspicious and demanding customers and the fear of "shit storms" that make many companies hesitate to advertise their sustainability progress ("green hushing"). Facts can help here! Test results can be verified, and external measurements can be linked so that your promises of digital sustainability appear verifiable and credible.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text-width-children mb0">
            <h3>What requirements apply to data protection, accessibility and environmental friendliness?</h3>
            <p>Further regulations will be added to the existing ones like the General Data Protection Regulation (<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation" target="_blank">GDPR</a>), like the European Accessibility Act (<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Accessibility_Act"
                target="_blank">EAA</a>), mostly based on the existing Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">WCAG</a>) defining minimum accessibility standards for websites. The planned <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/circular-economy/green-claims_en" target="_blank">Green Claims Directive</a> is supposed to create clear and transparent standards for environmental statements about products and services. The existing German <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_uwg/englisch_uwg.html" target="_blank">Act Against Unfair Competition (UWG)</a> already prohibits misleading statements also regarding the environmental friendliness of a website.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text-width-children mb0">
            <h3>Which tests can I do myself?</h3>
            <p>The best-known examples of ecological website checks include the <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Website Carbon Calculator</a>, <a href="https://ecograder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EcoGrader</a> and the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green
                Web Check</a>. Minimum accessibility requirements are checked by <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">axe</a> and <a
                href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WAVE</a>, while <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PageSpeed Insights</a> creates a comprehensive but often overly detailed performance report with recommendations for action.</p>

              <h3>What does it cost to test your website?</h3>
              <p>
                The costs depend on the scope of the order and the specificity and difficulty of the requirements.
                My current default hourly rate is in the <a href="https://www.ingo-steinke.de/#pricing">"pricing"</a> section of my homepage. Non-profit organisations and ethical start-ups can request discounts. Individual price agreements are also possible for long-term cooperation and invoicing according to daily rates. I would be happy to create a precise offer or a cost estimate.</p>
