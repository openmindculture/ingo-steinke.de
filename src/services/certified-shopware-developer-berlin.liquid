      <h3>Eco-friendly and GDPR-compliant e-commerce solutions</h3>
      <p>Shopware is freely available as a free community edition based on the open-source software Symfony. As a European solution with different hosting options, Shopware is an alternative to popular cloud providers. It lets us as shop owners keep total control over our shop. This allows us to meet our customers' high demands regarding data protection, environmental friendliness and fair trade.
      </p>
      <p>Shopware development inludes optimizing the frontend of an online shop, also known as the storefront, to make sure it's attractive, accessible, informative, and loads quickly.</p>

      <h3>Sustainable price transparency</h3>
      <p>In e-commerce, sustainability implies price transparency. <a href="{{ content.projectShopwareCostPluginLinkUrl }}" hreflang="en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Cost Transparency" is a free Shopware extension</a> that extends the Shopware 6 product details page by adding an interactive diagram to illustrate the different shares of the total price.</p>
